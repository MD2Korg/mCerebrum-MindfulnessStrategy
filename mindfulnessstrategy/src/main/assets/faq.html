style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>What
is mindfulness?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Mindfulness is a basic human ability that focuses on
paying attention to the current moment, in a particular way. Over time and with
practice, people can become more mindful. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>What
are some of the benefits of mindfulness?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Mindfulness can help you pay attention and focus on
what you want to at a specific moment, instead of letting your mind wander.
Mindfulness has also been related to better well-being and improved mood. For
smoking, mindfulness has been associated with lower cravings for cigarettes and
increased smoking abstinence. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Why
is it so important for me to focus on what’s happening right now?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Focusing on what is happening right now is a way to
practice focusing your attention to whatever you want to at a specific moment.
This can be really hard to do with all the distractions we have in life;
however, the more you practice focusing on what is happening now, the more
easily you’ll be able to do this over time. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Why
do I need to practice mindfulness?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Becoming more mindful is just like any other skill –
the more you practice, the more you will understand it. Over time, you will be
to apply it to your daily life more easily. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>How
am I supposed to focus on my thoughts if I’m supposed to let them pass by?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>You want to be aware of what thoughts are popping up
in your mind, in order to decide what to do with them. Some thoughts are more
useful than others. When trying to quit smoking, the following two thoughts
will likely impact your mood and behavior differently: “I want a cigarette” vs
“I want to take a walk.” By becoming more aware of these types of thoughts, you
have more control over how you deal with them. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Is
it ok to focus on what’s going on around me as long as I don’t fixate on it?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>As you practice mindfulness exercises, you will be
able to decide where you want your attention to go and for how long, depending
on what you need in that moment. You may decide to fixate on something, or not.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Mindfulness
involves movement? I just thought it was about breathing.</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Mindfulness is about putting your attention in a
certain place, at a certain time. This may involve paying attention to how your
body feels when you move, or even noticing if certain areas are tense or sore.
You can also pay attention to sensations that occur when you do daily
activities, like washing your hands or dishes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>8)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Why
is there such a focus on thoughts being right or wrong?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>When we judge something as right or wrong (or good or
bad), we can get distracted from what is actually happening. We want to “put
space” between our initial gut reaction and the decisions we later make. For
example, if you tell yourself you’re a bad person for craving a cigarette when
trying to quit smoking, you may end up smoking a cigarette. However, if you can
“hit the pause button” between that thought and making a decision, you may
instead be able to tell yourself that it is okay to crave a cigarette and that
you’re going to do something else instead. &nbsp;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>How
does being aware of my thoughts relate to me quitting smoking?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>When a craving to smoke occurs, it can feel like
smoking a cigarette is automatic. In other words, smoking becomes a habit.
Usually, cravings include thoughts related to smoking. Noticing these thoughts
can break the habit of automatically reaching for a cigarette. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>10)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></b><b>How will I feel when
practicing mindfulness?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>People feel many different things when practicing
mindfulness. You may feel more focused and calm. Other people feel happy or
relaxed. Sometimes mindfulness can be challenging, so you may occasionally feel
frustrated or anxious. All of these feelings are normal. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>11)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></b><b>Is mindfulness the
same thing as meditation?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Mindfulness and meditation are related, but slightly
different. Meditation is when you set aside a period of time to focus on
something specific (like your breathing or stretching). Mindfulness exercises
can include meditations, but they can also include paying attention to things
within your day-to-day activities, like the sounds you hear or the foods you
eat. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>12)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></b><b>Is this connected to
religion?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Mindfulness practices do originate from Buddhism.
However, many people who practice mindfulness are not Buddhist, and in fact,
may even follow a different religion (or no religion at all). It is up to you
whether you want your mindfulness practice to relate to religion or not.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><b>13)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></b><b>Can I practice
mindfulness anywhere?</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>Yes! In fact, you can pay attention to your breathing
right now, and you’re being mindful! Your breath is always with you, so drawing
your attention to your breathing can be really helpful when you’re experiencing
stress or a craving to smoke. </p>
